## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Recommended Additions to User Model

}

public function getMaintenanceCountAttribute(): int
{
    return $this->maintenances()->count();

{
    return $this->maintenances()->distinct('tree_id')->count('tree_id');
}
```

Add to `app/Models/Event.php`:

```php
public function maintenances()
{
    return $this->hasMany(TreeMaintenance::class, 'event_id');
