## 📊 New Tree Model Methods

Your `Tree` model now has these new methods:

```php
// Get all maintenance records
$tree->maintenanceRecords

// Get latest maintenance
$tree->latestMaintenance

// Get recent maintenances (last 30 days)
$tree->recentMaintenances(30)

// Get last maintenance date
$tree->last_maintenance_date

// Get total maintenance count
$tree->maintenance_count

// Get last recorded condition
$tree->last_condition

// Check if tree needs maintenance
$tree->needsMaintenance(7) // true if no maintenance in 7 days

// Get health score (0-100)
$tree->health_score
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ Authentication required for all endpoints  
✅ Users can only edit/delete their own records  
✅ Admins can edit/delete any records  
✅ Input validation on all fields  
✅ Image upload size limits (2MB per image, max 5 images)  
✅ SQL injection protection (Eloquent ORM)  
✅ CSRF protection

## 📱 Frontend Integration Example

```javascript
// Create maintenance record
const createMaintenance = async (data) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('tree_id', data.tree_id);
  formData.append('activity_type', data.activity_type);
  formData.append('performed_at', data.performed_at);
  formData.append('condition_after', data.condition_after);
  formData.append('notes', data.notes);
  
  // Add images
  data.images.forEach((image, index) => {
    formData.append(`images[${index}]`, image);
  });
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/tree-maintenance', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: formData
  });
  
  return response.json();
};

// Get tree maintenance history
const getTreeHistory = async (treeId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/trees/${treeId}/maintenance-history`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Accept': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Recommended (Optional) Additions:

```php
public function maintenances()
{
    return $this->hasMany(TreeMaintenance::class, 'user_id');
}
```

2. **Update Event Model** - Add maintenance relationships:
```php
public function maintenances()
{
    return $this->hasMany(TreeMaintenance::class, 'event_id');
}
```

3. **Build Frontend Components**
   - Maintenance form
   - Maintenance history timeline
   - Tree health dashboard
   - User activity stats

4. **Add Notifications**
   - Email when tree needs maintenance
   - Push notifications for maintenance reminders

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - Recurring maintenance tasks
   - Bulk maintenance recording
   - Export maintenance reports to PDF

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### Smart Tree Status Updates
When a maintenance record is created with condition:
- **Poor** → Tree status becomes "Sick"
- **Good/Excellent** → If tree was "Sick", it becomes "Planted"

### Automatic Health Scoring
Each tree gets a health score (0-100) based on the latest maintenance condition.

### Maintenance Needs Detection
The `needsMaintenance()` method tells you if a tree hasn't been maintained in X days.
